    <p>       
        A steak, also sometimes called "beef steak", is a meat generally sliced across
        the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though 
        it can also be pan-fried. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and
        kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 beef flat iron steak or boneless top sirloin steak (3/4 pound)</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pat dry  use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
        </li>
    </ol>
